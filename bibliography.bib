abstract = {Cryptocurrencies represent a new type of financial assets that are traded in a decentralized and transparent way. Recently, cryptocurrencies with large market capitalization (mostly Bitcoin) have been studied theoretically, but a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Here we explore the nonextensivity of price changes for 20 cryptocurrency exchanges from 2013 until 2017. We discover nonextensive triplets in the cryptocurrency market, where the three associated values for Bitcoin are remarkably close to those of the logistic map near the edge of chaos. The current findings strongly indicate that the cryptocurrency market represents a system whose physics is properly described by nonextensive statistical mechanics. Our results shed light on the complex and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, and establish the first formal link with the nonextensive theory.}

abstract="This paper is an extended version of the summary of experimental results reported by Dr. Pai and myself at the AGU meeting of April 1967, in Washington, D.C. The results pertain primarily to the M.I.T. data from IMP-1, launched in November 1963.( Figure 1, taken from Ness (1966), shows the first 30 orbits of IMP-1 projected into the ecliptic plane. Apogee is at about 30 earth radii, and the major axis of the first orbit points roughly toward the sun. The orbital period is about four days so that during each revolution the major axis of the orbit rotates by about 4{\textdegree} toward the dawn side of the earth. In a time span of about four months, the satellite explores a vast region that covers the noon, morning, dawn, and predawn portion of the magneto-sphere in the neighborhood of the ecliptic plane. Furthermore, and this is essential to the discussion, the large apogee makes it possible for the satellite not only to cross the sunward portion of the magnetosphere and the magnetosheath, but also to enter fairly deeply into the interplanetary domain where the presence of Earth's magnetic field is not felt.",

abstract = {Primordial nucleosynthesis is one of the three historical evidences for the big bang model, together with the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave background. There is a good global agreement between the computed primordial abundances of helium-4, deuterium, helium-3 and their values deduced from observations. Now that the number of neutrino families and the baryonic densities have been fixed by laboratory measurements or CMB observations, the model has no free parameter and its predictions are rigid. Since this is the earliest cosmic process for which we a priori know all the physics involved, departure from its predictions could provide hints or constraints on new physics or astrophysics in the early universe. Precision on primordial abundances deduced from observations has recently been drastically improved and reach the percent level for both deuterium and helium-4. Accordingly, the BBN predictions should reach the same level of precision. For most isotopes, the dominant sources of uncertainty come from those on the laboratory thermonuclear reactions. This article focuses on helium-4 whose predicted primordial abundance depends essentially on weak interactions which control the neutron–proton ratio. The rates of the various weak interaction processes depend on the experimentally measured neutron lifetime, but also includes numerous corrections that we thoroughly investigate here. They are the radiative, zero-temperature, corrections, finite nucleon mass corrections, finite temperature radiative corrections, weak-magnetism, and QED plasma effects, which are for the first time all included and calculated in a self consistent way, allowing to take into account the correlations between them, and verifying that all satisfy detailed balance. Finally, we include the incomplete neutrino decoupling and claim to reach a 10−4 accuracy on the helium-4 predicted mass fraction of 0.24709±0.00017 (when including the uncertainty on the neutron lifetime). In addition, we provide a Mathematica primordial nucleosynthesis code that incorporates, not only these corrections but also a full network of reactions, using the best available thermonuclear reaction rates, allowing the predictions of primordial abundances of helium-4, deuterium, helium-3 and lithium-7 but also of heavier isotopes up to the CNO region.}
